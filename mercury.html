            <p class="text">Home to extreme temperature changes and the fastest orbit around the sun of any planet; it may be small, but Mercury has so much to offer! 
                <br><b>Fun facts:</b>
                <br>• Mercury is shrinking because it has almost no atmosphere
                <br>• One day in Mercury is 59 days on Earth
                <br>• Mercury has only been studied by 2 spacecrafts
                <br>• Mercury is the closest planet to the sun, but it is NOT the hottest

            <h3 class="info-title">More Information</h3>
            <p class="info"><b>Size</b>: Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system. It is only ~2400 kilometres in radius. That’s only 38% of Earth’s size!
                <br><b>Surface</b>: Mercury has a dark gray and rocky surface. Its surface is extremely rough because it has no protection from meteors, so space debris will often leave scars on the planet. Mercury has been said to look like Earth’s moon, which is funny because Mercury has no moons!
                <br><b>Temperature</b>: Mercury doesn’t really have an atmosphere, so it has no weather. It gets very hot though because it is so close to the sun during the day. However, at night, it gets super cold because there is no atmosphere to trap the heat.

                    <h4 class="card-title">Caloris Basin</h4>
                    <p class="card-text">Since Mercury does not have a thick atmosphere to protect it from space debris, the planet is covered in craters. But none compare to the Caloris Basin.
                        <br><br>The Caloris basin was caused by a large meteor impact on the surface of Mercury. The impact must have been so large that it caused the ground on the other side of the planet to change! It is estimated to have been formed 3.9 billion years ago! 
                        <br><br>Caloris is over 1,500 kilometres wide. That’s over half the width of Mercury! The impact created walls around the basin that are over 2 kilometres tall.
                        <br><br>If you like what you get from Caloris, you may be interested in the Rembrandt Impact Basin as well. Although it is not as large, what it lacks in size, it more than makes up for in the pattern. With its “wheel and spoke” pattern, you won’t get many other basins quite as aesthetically pleasing.
